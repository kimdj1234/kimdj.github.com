    EZList is a mobile app mockup that will allow easier grocery shopping for all
    users. The basics of this app is to read/input in a shopping list, then based on
    different settings and preferences, the app will find different routes to stores that 
    will minimalize the cost of the entire shopping list!
    This idea was presented at the Atlas Expo at CU Boulder, and received very high remarks
    and interests!

  tagline: wordcount for github flavored markdown files
  tools: PHP
  description: |
    Developed for showing the wordcount of a Markdown GitHub flavored file. It essentially
    ignores all Markdown syntax in a file, as well as references and code blocks, and returns
    a number that corresponds to the number of "true words" there are.
