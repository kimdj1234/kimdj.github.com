        Utilized the GitHub Pages functionality to create my personal website. Prior to this I 
        have pratically no experience in the web based programming side of computer science, but
        I had a lot of fun figuring out everything from scratch!
    description2: |
        I used Jekyll and Bootstrap to render and customize everything that I wanted on this page.
        Then I simply push to my github repo and BAM it is live!

  - project: EZList
    modal: EZList
    intro: Prototype of an App
    tools: JustInMind
    icon: mobile
    url: https://github.com/zhued/EZList
    description1: |
        EZList is a mobile app mockup that will allow easier grocery shopping for all
        users. The basics of this app is to read/input in a shopping list, then based on
        different settings and preferences, the app will find different routes to stores that
        will minimalize the cost of the entire shopping list!
    description2: |
        My team used an application called <a href="http://www.justinmind.com/" 
        target="_blank">JustInMind</a> to implement a working, basic prototype of the application. 
        This project was done through the class CSCI 3002 Human Centered Computing.
        Throughout the semester, we learned the foundations of creating programs that
        focus on how humans will interact with it and how to better our designs based
        on that principle.

        very high remarks and intrests. Feel free to click on the More Info button on the bottom

    modal: MDWordcount
    intro: Wordcount for Markdown text files
    tools: PHP
    icon: toggle-down
    url: https://github.com/zhued/MDwordcounter
    description1: |
        Developed for showing the wordcount of a Markdown GitHub flavored file. It essentially
        ignores all Markdown syntax in a file, as well as references and code blocks, and returns
        a number that corresponds to the number of "true words" there are. 
    description2: |
        Written for CSCI 3155 - Principles of Programming Languages at CU Boulder by request of
        our instructor to grade and find the word count of our Markdown flavored final paper
        and presentation.

    tools: Markdown and Jekyll

    description1: |
        This blog was a spontaneous idea of mine to start conveying my random thoughts that I 
        have throughout the day. I tend to have personal rants to myself sometimes, so I guess
        a blog that I can just spew out everything would be a good thing. I'm not so good at writing
        in general, but I hope through this blog I can increase my writing expertise!
